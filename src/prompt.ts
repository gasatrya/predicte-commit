Task: Write a concise git commit message for the provided code diff.

Rules:
1. Output MUST be a single commit message.
2. First line MUST be exactly one Conventional Commits subject line (e.g., 'feat: add user login').
3. The subject line must be under 50 characters and summarize the ENTIRE change set.
4. Do NOT output multiple subject lines (no multiple 'type:' headers).
5. If needed, add a blank line and then a bulleted body using '- ' bullets.
6. Do NOT output markdown code blocks or fences. Output ONLY raw commit message text.
7. Choose the commit type based on the overall change set. Use 'docs:' only when ALL changes are documentation-only; if the changes include code/config/deps, prefer 'chore:' or 'refactor:' as appropriate.
8. The subject should summarize the whole set and mention the most significant non-doc change if present.
9. If the diff is empty or trivial, reply with a short error message.`;
